As of now there are many AI coding tools available. Most of them are quite popular and used by a lot of people, if you go by posts on social media. We wanted to describe three of these and compare them.
To make it easy to understand how they differ, we'll use images as well as text.

## First: v0

[v0](https://v0.dev) is an online tool with a generous free tier. It is great for UI design and frontend-heavy projects. It allows you to iterate quickly with a live preview. Once you are satisfied you can download the sources and use them in your project. Or directly deploy them to the [vercel](https://www.vercel.com) cloud.

## Second: Windsurf

[Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf) is an AI-enabled IDE with a lot of bang for the buck if you are willing to pay $15 (or whatever it is now) per month. It is great for MVPs and creative projects. We have frequently found that it can improvise and take a prototype forward in ways you didn't think of. It can work pretty well with small prompts - you can look at [our site](https://www.codepromptfu.com) for examples.

## Third: Codapt

[Codapt](https://codapt.ai) is a VSCode extension that it similar to Codeium. It is in restricted beta right now, so you might have to wait before you can get your hands on it. This tool puts a lot of thought and looks at your entire project before making changes. We have typically seen Windsurf getting a little too 'creative' after your project is a bit mature. Codapt is surprisingly wise in such situations, learns from the rest of your project and does the needful. We feel this tool should shine in software maintenance tasks, while most of the other tools are great at software creation.

## Conclusion

Of course, these are not the only tools out there. If you look at the following thread on X, you'll see there are almost 40 tools in the market. You need to use many of them, at different times, for different purposes.
