The most recent explanation comes from this post on X:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There&#39;s a new kind of coding I call &quot;vibe coding&quot;, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It&#39;s possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisperâ€¦</p>&mdash; Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

First came the LLMs and they were really good for understanding or generating code snippets. Then came the AI coding tools, which use LLMs under the hood. These tools can produce software out of much simpler prompts, because they are aware of your entire project. These are the prompts we are curating.
