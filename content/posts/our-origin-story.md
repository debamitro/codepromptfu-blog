The [CodePromptFu](https://www.codepromptfu.com) website was created sometime in early January 2025. Most of the development has been prompt-based, in [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf). This is how the first few hours of its development looked like.

## Version 0

## Conclusion

Step-by-step development using concise prompts works with today's AI-based coding tools. [CodePromptFu](https://www.codepromptfu.com) is still a work in progress, so it is entirely possible that AI-based tools might not help later on. Or, a completely different category of prompts might be needed to solve production problems. We will know as we keep making progress in prompt engineering.
